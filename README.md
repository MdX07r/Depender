5. Stores the original URL in `X-URL`

### Advanced Web Application Options
```bash
# Custom name
depender create-webapp https://example.com -n "My Custom Name"

# Custom categories
depender create-webapp https://example.com -c "Network;WebBrowser;"

# Custom icon URL
depender create-webapp https://example.com -i https://example.com/custom-icon.png

# Create with specific browser
depender create-webapp https://example.com --exec "firefox --private-window %U"
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Native Application Management

### Creating Native Applications
```bash
# Basic native application
depender create-native "VS Code" "code"

# With description and icon
depender create-native "VS Code" "code" -d "Code editing. Redefined." -i /usr/share/icons/vscode.png
```

### Managing Applications
```bash
# List applications with search
depender list -s "browser"

# List applications in JSON format
depender list -j

# View detailed application information
depender info "Google Chrome"

# Remove an application
depender remove "Google Chrome"
```

```

### Capsule Integration
- Web applications appear as capsules in the Desind interface
- Automatic categorization based on website content

```bash
# Create multiple web applications from a list
cat websites.txt | while read url; do
  depender create-webapp "$url"
done

# Export all web applications to JSON
depender list -w -j > webapps.json
```

### Programmatic Use
```bash
# Get application path for scripting
APP_PATH=$(depender info "Example" | grep "File Path" | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d ' ')
xdg-open "$APP_PATH"
```

### Custom Browser Profiles
```bash
# Create web app with custom browser profile
depender create-webapp https://gmail.com -n "Gmail" \
